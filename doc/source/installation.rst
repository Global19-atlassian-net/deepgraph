Installation
************


Quick Install
=============

DeepGraph can be installed via pip from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepgraph>`_

::

   $ pip install deepgraph

Depending on your system, you may need root privileges. On UNIX-based operating
systems (Linux, Mac OS X etc.) this is achieved with sudo

::

   $ sudo pip install deepgraph

Alternatively, if you're using `Conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_,
install with

::

   $ conda install -c conda-forge deepgraph


Installing from Source
======================

Alternatively, you can install DeepGraph from source by downloading a source
archive file (tar.gz or zip).


Source Archive File
-------------------

  1. Download the source (tar.gz or zip file) from
     https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepgraph/
     or https://github.com/deepgraph/deepgraph/

  2. Unpack and change directory to the source directory (it should have the
     files README.rst and setup.py).

  3. Run :samp:`python setup.py install` to build and install.
     As a developer, you may want to install using cython:
     :samp:`python setup.py install --use-cython`.

  4. (Optional) Run :samp:`py.test` to execute the tests if you have
     `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_ installed.


GitHub
------

  1. Clone the deepgraph repostitory

       git clone https://github.com/deepgraph/deepgraph.git

  2. Change directory to :samp:`deepgraph`

  3. Run :samp:`python setup.py install` to build and install.
     As a developer, you may want to install using cython:
     :samp:`python setup.py install --use-cython`.

  4. (Optional) Run :samp:`py.test` to execute the tests if you have
     `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_ installed.


Installing without Root Privileges
----------------------------------

If you don't have permission to install software on your system, you can
install into another directory using the :samp:`--user`, :samp:`--prefix`,
or :samp:`--home` flags to setup.py.

For example

::

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/python

or

::

    $ python setup.py install --home=~

or

::

    $ python setup.py install --user

Note: If you didn't install in the standard Python site-packages directory you
will need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to the alternate location. See
`here <https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html#modifying-python-s-search-path>`_
for further details.


Requirements
============

The easiest way to get Python and the required/optional packages is to use
`Conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ (or
`Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_), a cross-platform (Linux, Mac
OS X, Windows) Python distribution for data analytics and scientific computing.


Python
------

To use DeepGraph you need `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 2.7, 3.4 or
later.


Pandas
------

`Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is an open source, BSD-licensed library
providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools
for the Python programming language.

Pandas is the core dependency of DeepGraph, and it is highly recommended to
install the
`recommended <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#recommended-dependencies>`_
and
`optional <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#optional-dependencies>`_
dependencies of Pandas as well.


NumPy
-----

`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ is the fundamental package for scientific
computing with Python.

Needed for internal operations.


Recommended Packages
====================

The following are recommended packages that DeepGraph can use to provide
additional functionality.


Matplotlib
----------

`Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ is a python 2D plotting library which
produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and
interactive environments across platforms.

Allows you to use the :ref:`plotting methods <plotting_methods>` of DeepGraph.


Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit
--------------------------

`basemap <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`_ is an add-on toolkit for matplotlib
that lets you plot data on map projections with coastlines, lakes, rivers and
political boundaries. See the
`basemap tutorial <https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for
documentation and examples of what it can do.

Used by :py:meth:`plot_map <.plot_map>` and
:py:meth:`plot_map_generator <.plot_map_generator>` to plot networks on map
projections.


PyTables
--------

`PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/>`_ is a package for managing hierarchical
datasets and designed to efficiently and easily cope with extremely large
amounts of data.

Necessary for HDF5-based storage of pandas DataFrames. DeepGraph's
:py:class:`core class <.DeepGraph>` may be initialized with a HDFStore
containing a node table in order to iteratively create edges directly from disc
(see :py:meth:`create_edges <.create_edges>` and
:py:meth:`create_edges_ft <.create_edges_ft>`).


SciPy
-----

`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source
software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

Allows you to convert from DeepGraph's network representation to sparse adjacency
matrices (see :py:meth:`return_cs_graph <.return_cs_graph>`).


NetworkX
--------

`NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ is a Python language software package
for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and
functions of complex networks.

Allows you to convert from DeepGraph's network representation to NetworkX's network
representation (see :py:meth:`return_nx_graph <.return_nx_graph>`).


Graph-Tool
----------

`graph\_tool <https://graph-tool.skewed.de/>`_ is an efficient Python module for
manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs (a.k.a. networks).

Allows you to convert from DeepGraph's network representation to Graph-Tool's
network representation (see :py:meth:`return_gt_graph <.return_gt_graph>`).

Conda users can install graph_tool by adding the following channels to their
~/.condarc

::

   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
   $ conda config --add channels ostrokach-forge

Then, install graph-tool

::

   $ conda install graph-tool

You can test your graph-tool installation by

::

   $ python -c "from graph_tool.all import *"


Optional Packages
=================

The following packages are considered to provide very useful tools and methods.


Scikit-Learn
------------

`sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ is a Python module integrating
classical machine learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific
Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).


Sklearn-pandas
--------------

`sklearn-pandas <https://github.com/paulgb/sklearn-pandas>`_ provides a bridge
between Scikit-Learn's machine learning methods and pandas-style Data Frames.
